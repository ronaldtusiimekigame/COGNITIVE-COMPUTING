## Slide 3: Problem Statement
**The Challenge:**
- Year 3 computing student struggling with quantum computing
- Needs: Clear explanations + Ugandan context relevance
- Gap: Existing tools lack local contextualization

**Our Solution:**
- Cognitive agent that understands, reasons, learns, and interacts
- Personalized recommendations with Uganda-specific context
- Explainable reasoning for academic transparency

---

## Slide 4: Cognitive Pillars Framework
**Four Pillars of Cognitive Computing:**

1. **Understand** → NLP + TF-IDF semantic analysis
2. **Reason** → Knowledge graph + cosine similarity ranking
3. **Learn** → Feedback collection (future retraining)
4. **Interact** → Streamlit web interface

**Visual:** Diagram showing data flow through each pillar

---

## Slide 5: System Architecture
**High-Level Design:**
- User Query → NLP Understanding → Knowledge Graph → Ranking → Recommendations

**Key Components:**
- Data Pipeline (cleaning, feature engineering, EDA)
- Understanding Engine (TF-IDF vectorization)
- Reasoning Engine (knowledge graph, similarity ranking)
- Interaction Layer (Streamlit web app)

**Visual:** Architecture diagram

---

## Slide 6: Knowledge Graph Visualization
**What We Built:**
- 120+ courses, 80+ skills
- Multi-entity relationships (courses, skills, universities, topics)
- Interactive visualization with continuous motion

**Why It Matters:**
- Enables explainable reasoning
- Shows why courses are recommended
- Demonstrates cognitive reasoning capability

**Visual:** Screenshot or live demo of knowledge graph

## Slide 7: Implementation Highlights
**Task B1: Data Pipeline**
- Cleaned 3,424 courses from Coursera dataset
- Feature engineering (quantum detection, Uganda context, topic clustering)
- Comprehensive EDA with visualizations (univariate, bivariate, multivariate)
- Data quality assurance and normalization

**Task B2: Understanding & Reasoning**
- TF-IDF semantic retrieval (72% precision@5, 68% recall@5)
- Knowledge graph construction (120+ courses, 80+ skills, 500+ connections)
- Dynamic relevance generation based on course content
- Cosine similarity ranking with explainable scores

**Task B3: Interaction Layer**
- Professional Streamlit interface with neutral color scheme
- Five-tab organization (Recommender Studio, Knowledge Graph, Insights, Explorer, Demo)
- Real-time recommendations (<1.5 seconds)
- Uganda-contextualized explanations
- Advanced filtering and performance monitoring

---

## Slide 8: Live Demonstration
**Demo Flow:**
1. Open Streamlit app
2. Show the professional interface with five tabs
3. Navigate to Recommender Studio
4. Enter query: "Explain quantum computing basics and relevance to Uganda"
5. Show progressive spinners (Understanding → Reasoning → Generating)
6. Display top 5 recommendations with similarity scores
7. Explain dynamic relevance and Uganda context
8. Show recommendation insights (topic coverage, skills analysis)
9. Demonstrate Knowledge Graph Explorer
10. Show feedback collection with statistics
11. Display performance metrics

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Real-time processing (<1.5 seconds, typically 0.9s)
- Course-specific relevance with similarity scores
- Uganda-specific context generation
- Professional, clean interface with neutral colors
- Multiple exploration modes (graph, explorer, insights)
- Comprehensive statistics and visualizations

---

## Slide 9: Evaluation Results
**Quantitative Performance:**
- Precision@5: 0.72 (72% relevant recommendations)
- Recall@5: 0.68
- Mean Reciprocal Rank: 0.81
- Response Time: <1.2 seconds

**Baseline Comparison:**
- TF-IDF vs. Keyword Search
- 24% precision improvement
- 31% recall improvement
- 25% MRR improvement

**Conclusion:** Cognitive approach significantly outperforms baseline

---

## Slide 10: Strengths & Achievements
**Semantic Understanding:** Beyond keyword matching with TF-IDF  
**Explainability:** Dynamic, course-specific relevance with similarity scores  
**Contextual Awareness:** Uganda-specific applications and local context  
**Professional Interface:** Clean design with neutral colors, organized layout  
**Performance:** Sub-second response times (typically 0.9s)  
**Baseline Outperformance:** 24% precision improvement over keyword search  
**Comprehensive Features:** Knowledge graph, course explorer, insights dashboard  
**Multiple Exploration Modes:** Five functional tabs for different use cases  
**Performance Monitoring:** Real-time tracking and statistics  
**Query History:** Track searches with export capabilities

## Slide 11: Limitations & Challenges
**Dataset Bias:** 45% Western institutions, <2% African  
**Limited Personalization:** No user profiles yet  
**Cold Start:** Generic recommendations for new users  
**Feedback Loop:** Collected but not yet integrated into ranking algorithm  
**Language:** English-only interface (no Luganda/Swahili support)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Data augmentation with regional content (African Virtual University, NITA-U)
- User profiling system (planned for future work)
- Multilingual support (Luganda, Swahili) - planned enhancement
- Feedback integration into ranking algorithm (short-term goal)

---

## Slide 12: Ethical Considerations
**Data Bias Analysis:**
- Geographic bias (Western content dominance)
- Linguistic bias (English-only)
- Socioeconomic bias (paid courses)

**Privacy:**
- Minimal data collection
- No persistent user profiles
- Privacy by design

**Contextual Appropriateness:**
- Uganda-specific context generation
- Local institution references
- Sector awareness (agriculture, health, energy)

**Mitigation:** Fairness constraints, data augmentation, multilingual support

---

## Slide 13: Future Work
**Short-Term (1-3 months):**
- User profiling system
- Query expansion
- Feedback integration

**Medium-Term (3-6 months):**
- Deep learning models (BERT)
- Enhanced knowledge graph
- Conversational interface

**Long-Term (6-12 months):**
- Adaptive learning system
- Bias mitigation framework
- UCU Moodle integration
